# chatbot
This is my first try with a chatbot.

THis bot is very dump, so  be aware of stupidness.

## How to install
1. git clone in a directory of your choice.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dwijen/chatbot.git
```
> It creates a chatbot directory
2. cd chatbot
3. virtualenv venv
4. source venv/bin/activate
5. pip install -r requirement.txt


## How to run
Execute from terminal **python first.py**
> It will take little time to start up and also may be little slow in response depending upon the system you are using


## Example
```shell
hello chatbot
/Users/dwijen.b/Documents/chatbot/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/chatterbot/storage/jsonfile.py:26: UnsuitableForProductionWarning: The JsonFileStorageAdapter is not recommended for production environments.
